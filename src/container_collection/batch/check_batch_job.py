def check_batch_job(job_arn: str, max_retries: int) -> Union[int, State, bool]:
    """
    Check for exit code of an AWS Batch job.

    If this task is running within a Prefect flow, it will use the task run
    context to get the current run count. While the run count is below the
    maximum number of retries, the task will continue to attempt to get the exit
    code, and can be called with a retry delay to periodically check the status
    of jobs.

    If this task is not running within a Prefect flow, the ``max_retries``
    parameters is ignored. Jobs that are still running will throw an exception.

    Parameters
    ----------
    job_arn
        Job ARN.
    max_retries
        Maximum number of retries.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Exit code if the job is complete, otherwise throws an exception.
